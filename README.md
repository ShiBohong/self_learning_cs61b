# SBH's Tour of Learning CS61B
### I'm Learning CS61B by myself, and this folder record my learning process.
For most of the labs and projects, I refer to the class in 2018. And for lectures, I refer to the class in 2024. Additionaly, I plan to do Project 0 and Project 2 in sp21, which is quite interesting and meaningful.
